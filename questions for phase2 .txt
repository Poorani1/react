Questions:

1. If we switch from overview to claims by site of care should the dropdown values sustain or default selection should load?
	Should we use all the dropdowns in overview page to other pages? or some dropdowns should be removed as needed. If so can we list down the dropdowns per page?
2. Instaed of Load more button can we use Pagination?
	If going to use Load more then after clicking load more how to come to previous view ex: show less button should be there?
3. sorted column color: colour grading should be there or can we use same color for the whole column?
4. Export table button should we keep it or remove?
